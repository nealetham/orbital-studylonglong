# STUDYLONGLONG


STUDYLONGLONG is a one-stop productivity mobile application that aims to meets your needs! Developed under the [Orbital Programme](https://orbital.comp.nus.edu.sg/) organised by the [National University of Singapore's School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/).

STUDYLONGLONG was developed under the *Gemini* [Level of Achievement](https://orbital.comp.nus.edu.sg/levels-of-achievement/) but was subsequently awarded with *Apollo 11* due in part to our SWE practices and extensive documentation throughout the entire SDLC.
